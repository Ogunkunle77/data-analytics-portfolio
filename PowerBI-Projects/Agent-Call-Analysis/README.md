# Agent Call Analysis – Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes call center operations using Power BI to evaluate agent performance, call outcomes, customer demographics, and call trends over time.

The dashboard was designed to help management understand service efficiency, identify performance gaps, and make data-driven decisions to improve call resolution rates, staffing allocation, and overall customer support experience.

Using call data, customer attributes, and agent activity records, interactive reports were built to track key performance indicators such as total calls handled, successful calls, abandoned calls, failed calls, follow-up requirements, and workload distribution across agents and regions.
## 🛠 Tools Used
- Power BI
- Power Query (Data Cleaning & Transformation)
- DAX Measures for KPIs
- Interactive Visualizations and Slicers

## 📊 Key Insights

- Out of 200,000 total calls, a large portion were abandoned or failed, highlighting service delivery challenges.
- Agent workload is unevenly distributed, suggesting the need for better call allocation strategies.
- Certain states generate significantly higher call volumes, useful for regional planning and support.
- Majority of callers are from the middle-income bracket and predominantly male.
- High number of calls required follow-up, indicating low first-call resolution rate.
- Call patterns vary by month and day, which can inform staffing and shift scheduling.
